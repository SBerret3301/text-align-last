Explanation:

1. `.a`, `.b`, `.c`: These are CSS classes that are used to style specific paragraphs differently using the `text-align-last` property.

   - `.a`: Applies right alignment to the last line of text in the paragraph.
   
   - `.b`: Applies center alignment to the last line of text in the paragraph.
   
   - `.c`: Applies justification to the last line of text in the paragraph.

The HTML document contains main and subheadings along with paragraphs demonstrating different text alignments within the last line using the `text-align-last` property. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
